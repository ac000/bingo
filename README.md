## Overview

A simple C/GTK+3 application for playing bingo. It randomly draws numbers
from *1* to *90*, displays the numbers that have been drawn both as they come
out and also as a 10x9 grid in numerical order to make for easy checking of
*lines* and *full houses*. It will also give the saying for each number
(where there is one).

To start playing hit, *Play*, to pause it hit *Pause*.

## Build & Run

Simple type *make* and then run it as *./bingo*. It's currently designed to
run at 1920x1080

You can edit the saying for each number by editing *sayings.h*
